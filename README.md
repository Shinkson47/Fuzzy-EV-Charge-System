# A Fuzzy Logic Electric Vehichle Charge Management System

As a part of a unviversity module looking into fuzzy inference systems, I developed this EV charging system.

It takes in several readings of the car's battery and the connected charger, and tries to use fuzzy logic to inffer at which level the battery should charge.

The charge speed it chooses depends on the health of the battery, it's current charge level, and is limited by the available charge power and under/over heat events.
The system also manages the heat of the battery to keep it within the optimal temperature range.

Between the temperature and charge rate, the main goal of this system is to prolonge the lifespan of the cars battery pack for as long as possible.
